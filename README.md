Set of scripts aimed to build one or several simulation domains to simulate at chaman flow solver, and visualize the results.

This repository contains two main directories: pre and post

## pre

Build your own simulation domain with the desired geometry and export it through some files in order to run it in chaman.

## post

Takes the _rgc_ outputs of chaman flow solver as input and generates the desired visualization of the results.

## Comments

The python interpreter has several implementations, the most common one by far is CPython.

Use SymPy to integrate symbolic mathematical expressions.
