Set of scripts aimed to build one or several simulation domains to simulate at chaman flow solver, and visualize the results.

This repository contains two main directories: pre and post

## pre

Manages the assemble of structured blocks grids of a desired geometry and other configurations needed to run a simulation in chaman flow solver.
Returns the needed files to run a flow simulation in chaman.

## post

Takes the *rgc* outputs of chaman flow solver as input and generates the desired visualization of the results.
